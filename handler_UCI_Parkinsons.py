""" Python file with methods to handle the UCI_Parkinsons DataFile.

Remarks
=========================
Data Set Information:

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.

The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around 200 recordings per patient, the subject number of the patient is identified in the first column.

Attribute Information:
=========================

subject# - Integer that uniquely identifies each subject
age - Subject age
sex - Subject gender '0' - male, '1' - female
test_time - Time since recruitment into the trial. The integer part is the number of days since recruitment.
motor_UPDRS - Clinician's motor UPDRS score, linearly interpolated
total_UPDRS - Clinician's total UPDRS score, linearly interpolated
Jitter(%),Jitter(Abs),Jitter:RAP,Jitter:PPQ5,Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
Shimmer,Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,Shimmer:APQ11,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
RPDE - A nonlinear dynamical complexity measure
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
PPE - A nonlinear measure of fundamental frequency variation

    Reads the complete excel sheet and returns it as a 2D Numpy Array or pandas

    Parameters
    --------------
    return_type : string ('np' or 'pd')
        Datatype of return object. If 'np', data is returned as a 2D numpy array.
        If 'pd', data is returned as a 2D DataFrame

    scaling : string 'MinMax', 'MeanVar', or 'None'
        Determines the column-wise scaling of the data.

    predict : string 'motor_UPDRS', or 'total_UPDRS'
        Variable to predict (last column of returned matrix)

    Returns
    -------------
    Returns the data object containing the entire excel sheet. If return_type is
    'np', return object is a 2D Numpy Array storing the Y-variable in the last
    column. Else it is a pandas dataframe with the descriptors given in the
    excel sheet.
